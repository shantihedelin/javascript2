  // Task 1: Create a variable called `newYearsResolutions` and set it's value to be a new array with at
  // least 3 strings inside of it.
  // Task 2: Create a new variable called `nextNewYearsResolution` and set it's value to the first
  // item from the newYearsResolutions array (see the docs above for a hint on how to select items
  // from arrays).

  // Task 3: Use console.log() to print the 3rd item in the newYearsResolutions array without setting
  // any variables.
